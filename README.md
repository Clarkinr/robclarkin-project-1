## Features

### -Navigation

    - A navigation bar with three clickable links on the right hand side of all pages (these are moved to the left on smaller devices)
    - A "logo" in the left corner which when clicked links to the home page
    - The navigation is intended to mimic a standard format for ease of use by the user

### - Standard page formatting (Header and main images)
    - The header font was chosen using Adobe kuler to match with the Physical literacy graphics used
    - Each page features a different main image with an tag line intended to represent the page's content
    - The images were all chosen from Pexels and represent physical activity

### - About and Benefits page structure
    - Both pages are divided into three sections; main image followed by 2 subsequent sections
    - The about page is intended to define what Physical Literacy is and give the user a video to help extend their knowledge
    - The Benefits page is intended to show the physical and mental benefits of being physicaly active. 
    - Across all pages I have used images of multiple age atheletes to convey that physical literacy is a life long pursuit.

### - The Footer
    - The Footer consits of contact information and social media links
    - The footer colour was chosen to match the header text

### - Testing
    - I tested the browser in Chrome and Firefox
    - I tested the responsive elements of the site using the chrome development tools and ensured that it functions well across multiple screen sizes
    - The form requirement elements were checked to ensure that all working
    - I checked that all clickable links internally open in the same window and externally open in new tabs

## - Validator testing
### - HTML
    - There were a few html errors upon my first test
    - These were fixed using the W3C validator reccomendation
    - Examples of these were using an <a> tag as part of an unordered list without it being added as a list item.

### - CSS
    - There was one common error when CSS was validated
    - These were fixed using the jigsaw validator reccomendation
    - The CSS issue found was that a closing } or ; was not found in 3 instances

### - Lighthouse 
    - I performed a lighthouse test on both the desktop and mobile level
    - Both showed good levels of accesibility, seo and best practices
    - The results can be seen below

## Unfixed bugs
    - The form does not actually link to anywhere at present
    - The 2 clickable containers on the index page do not scale perfectly when resized, however they are equal on most standard screensizes at full screen
